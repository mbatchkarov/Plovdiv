{"name":"Project Plovdiv","tagline":"A simple network epidemiology simulator","body":"# Plovdiv\r\n\r\nProject Plovdiv is a network epidemiology simulator and can be used to teach basic graph theory. It is primarily aimed at students and demonstrates some of the basic concepts of graph theory and epidemiology. Nodes in the graph (individuals) can be infected or vaccinated, and several different types of epidemics can be visualised. We provide a flexible and visually appealing front end to facilitate the teaching process.\r\n\r\nPlovdiv is not intended for detailed modelling or efficiency but rather as a  supplementary course resource. Our main goals throughout the development process were simplicity and ease of use as well as mathematical correctness.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 1](https://github.com/mbatchkarov/Plovdiv/raw/master/docs/img/overall.png \"Plovdiv in action\")\r\n\r\n# History\r\nPlovdiv is based on two separate pieces of software, dating back to 2009. The first one was developed under the York Transit Bursary Scheme under the supervision of Dr Daniel Franks, and the second at the University of Sussex under Dr Istvan Kiss. The large majority of work was done in 2014 by Miroslav Batchkarov and Vladislav Donchev.\r\n\r\n# License\r\nPlovdiv is distributed under a three-clause BSD license.
