Plovdiv
=======

Project Plovdiv is a network epidemiology simulator and can be used to teach basic graph theory. It is primarily aimed at students and demonstrates some of the basic concepts of epidemiology. Nodes in the graph (Individuals) can be infected or vaccinated, and several different types of epidemics can be visualised.

The screenshots below show the application in action.
